What is the structure of the data?
How many earthquakes does it list?
How would you grab the first earthquake?
How would you grab it's title?
How would you grab it's geological coordinates:
latitude?
longitude?
When did it happen?
How many hours ago is that?
Now, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the layout in index.html.
