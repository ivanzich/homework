Hando is a frustrated young man living in Australia who desires power over others because he lacks control over himself. Hando is a skinhead, and a devotee of Adolf Hitler. He collects Nazi memorabilia and quotes from Mein Kampf, but has no job or visible means of support beyond the dole. He lives with a group of other skins who look to him as a leader, but can only lead them into conflict with the law, the local Asian population, and indeed the entire world as he tries to get violent revenge on a group of Asians who buy out the local pub and chase him and his friends from their home.
