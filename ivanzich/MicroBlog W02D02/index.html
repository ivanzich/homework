					<p>The other day, a friend asked me for a favor. I gave him an instant yes.The instant yes is precious. It's earned, it doesn't last forever, it's easily abused.Not the yes of, "I'll look it over and if it makes sense or fits in my calendar or is profitable then of course, I'll do it," but the yes of, "yes."Do you want to try our daily special, it's really good? Do you want to see my new project proposal? Will you come to this event I'm holding? Will you contribute to this discussion? Can I borrow $500?How many people will give you an instant yes if you ask them? How many times has your organization (or you) earned the privilege of the benefit of the doubt? </p>

					<p>...until it works.That's what innovation is. Mistakes, experiments, mis-steps. Until it works.The process isn't to avoid the things that don't work. Because that means avoiding the things that might not work....instead, our job is to eagerly embrace the mistakes on the road to the impact that we seek. <br />
