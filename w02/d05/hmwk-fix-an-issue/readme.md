# Weekend Lab - Fix an Issue

## This weekend you will fix issues your classmates made on your repo.

- Work on a branch
- When you have fixed an issue, before merging your branch take a screenshot of the Compare Changes page on Github, showing the difference between the two branches. Check out [these docs](https://help.github.com/articles/comparing-commits-across-time/#comparing-branches) to learn how to do this.
- Submit these screenshots to your homework folder.

### Have a great weekend!
