# Create an Issue Lab

### Objectives
*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

- Identify issues on existing code
- Create an issue on a GitHub repo


### Preparation
*Before this lesson, students should already be able to:*

- Use git and github

## Code Review

Find a partner to share your code with and swap links to the repos you will be working on. 
Clone their code and spin it up on your own computer so you can test it in your browser. Review the code itself. 

Look for:

- Any bugs
- Missing Functionality
- Desirable features

## Read The Docs

- Check out GitHub's [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) on creating an issue.

- Check out [this blog post](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-write-our-github-issues/) on how to create a good issue.

## Create at least 2 issues on your partners repo

## Find a new partner and repeat!

Your homework this weekend will be to fix the issues your classmates created on your code.

Once you have fixed them, close the issue via [pull request](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests) or [commit message](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
