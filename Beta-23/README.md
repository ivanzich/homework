*** What's my Game ***


	~Battleship~

	I wanted to create a game my son would enjoy playing and be challenged.

	User Stories: As the developer I want to create an experience where children wants to come back and play the game over and over.  As a kid and user of the Battleship Game, I want to be engaged and challenged to beat my opponent. Wanting to come back again to play this classic game!

	Play:  During play the players and computer take turns is making a shot at the opponent board, by ramdomly calling out the coordinates of a square on game board.

	Moves: During play computer should record their opponent's shots on grid as "Red Cell" for a hit and "White Cell" for a miss.

	Board: Computer and Player have 5 x 5 grids, labelled along the sides with letters and numbers (checkbox grid).
	Each ship occupies a number of adjacent squares on the grid, horizontally or vertically. Diagonal not allowed.

	End Game: The first player to lose all their ships loses the game.
