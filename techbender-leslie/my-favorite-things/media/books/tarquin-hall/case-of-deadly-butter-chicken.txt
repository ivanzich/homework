"The Case of the Deadly Butter Chicken" by Tarquin Hall

SUMMARY: When an elderly Pakistani visiting India dies frothing at the mouth during a banquet, it’s not a simple case of Delhi Belly. His butter chicken has been poisoned. To solve the case, India’s “Most Private Investigator,” Vish Puri, must infiltrate the dangerous world of illegal gambling, following a trail that leads deep into Pakistan—the country in which many members of the investigator’s family were massacred during the 1947 partition of India. The last piece of the puzzle, however, turns up closer to home when Puri learns of the one person who can identify the killer. Unfortunately it is the one person in the world with whom he has sworn never to work: his Mummy-ji.
