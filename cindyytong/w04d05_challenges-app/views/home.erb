<p>On New Year's Day, I was challenged to complete a dry month (life sans alcohol, not the rubbing kind). The first ten days were rough especially since I was in the process of moving to San Francisco. It was particularly difficult for me to resist the temptation of alcohol during my going away party. But once I reached midway, the urge for a drink slowly dissipated and by the end of January, I was not thristing for that whiskey neat. I ended up unintentionally dry for 6 more days. My dry month finally ended when I grabbed a social drink during a happy hour for my coding bootcamp. I was incredibly proud of myself at the end of the dry month because, not only did I save $ from all of the unordered drinks, but I also proved to myself that I had the integrity to remove a bad habit from my life. Hooked on the endorphin rush I received when I conquered my challenge, I decided to continue on with new monthly challenges of removing a bad habit or introducing good habits into my life. </p>
