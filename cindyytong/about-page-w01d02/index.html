      <p>Hi there! I&#8217m Cindy Tong: a born and raised New Yorker who just moved out to the West Coast. I spend my days stumbling on new challenges and living fully. 

      <p>After graduating from NYU&#8217s College of Arts and Sciences with an accelerated three-year Bachelor&#8217s degree in Economics and Art History, I considered Law School while I worked on the Structured Products division of law firm, Davis Polk and Wardwell. Our primary clients included Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup.</p> 

      <p>To satisfy my penchant for NYC property voyeurism, I became a licensed real estate salesperson and the Business and Operations Manager for the McDonough Hershkowitz Team at Core. With over $800 million in NYC residential sales under our belt, we were recognized in 2015 by <em>Forbes</em> as the 25th highest grossing team in NYC.</p>  
   
      <b>More About Me!</b>

      <p>I enjoy exploring new cuisines, dressing up my family's cute terrier, Blue, laughing at my own jokes, absorbing the sunrise and live music.</p> 

      <p>Want to know more about me? Don&#8217t be shy and drop me a <a href ="mailto:tongcindyy@gmail.com">line</a>.</p>
