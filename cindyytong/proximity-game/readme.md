###I. Description:
Proximity is a quiz game that tests your knowledge on the restaurants near the General Assembly Campus. Users are asked to identify the name of a restaurant when shown its location on a map along with its address. For each question right, the user gains a point. The game is best played on a desktop in full screen mode.

###II. How Was This Project Built:
Proximity was built using the Google Places API, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap and a lot of *emotional self management*. 


####III.How to Contribute:
There are many areas for improvement, including:

*adding Geolocations so that users can use their own location to search for nearby restaurants

*debugging my code for the random number generator to allow for my than 5 questions

*beautifying and cleaning up the styling

*searching for different categories of places (i.e. tourist attractions, shops, etc)

*allowing multiple players

*adding a login to allow for scores to be saved

If you're up for the challenge and would like to start contributing, just fork this repo and get started. Please replace my API key with your own key.
