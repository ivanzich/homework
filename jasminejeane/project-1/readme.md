##Technologies

-Gimp Image editior to cut puzzle peices

-JqueyUI

-Jquery

-CSS

-gifs




##Approach

Try everything and see what works lol

I tried to sudo code things out and put my major needs points together. But I think next time I was have a better planning process.


##Game instructions

If using the game where you can not move peice once dropped. You only have one attempt

The game will keep track of the attempts you had to make to finish the puzzle either way every time

You have to refresh the screen to start the game over but it will be stored what you attempts were on you last try


##Unsolved Problems

Major Problem. Not being able to get peices to move after being dropped.

I got it figured out but the way my peices are cut the images would have to be squares to work with the detachable function.


Reset button doesn't work yet. Didn't really get a chance to get going on that. 

##Proud moments

Frozen font.
Getting local storage to log numbers

Finding a way to track if peices were a match even though it got my caught up on a droppable bug.

All the other ways I found seem to complicated.
