## Summary

Imagine you want to let people write really short public blog posts. The homepage of your microblog app should be a list of these micro-posts with a form to add a new one. We don't have a backend yet, so we won't be worrying about login, users, followers, and all of that good stuff quite yet. The new posts won't even stay on the page when we refresh. But we can create new blog posts, have them added to the page!

Something like this:

Skills:

- Use Git to save your progress!
- Use JavaScript to access the DOM
- Style your blog using CSS.

2. Start by creating a folder with index.html, style.css and app.js files and initializing a git repo.

3. Make frequent commits and pushes. You should commit every time you add a new feature, and it is working! A feature can be something as small as adding a little style.
4. Make a list of `posts` using HTML strings and JavaScript that render to the DOM.
5. Make a form to add new `posts` to the list using JavaScript.

## Stretch Challenges (optional)

* Add a count of how many posts have been posted that updates every time a new post is created.
* Save `posts` to [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) or [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

### Need more to do?
1. Check out [this excellent talk](https://vimeo.com/105955605) in which Mary Rose Cook live codes Space Invaders from scratch in 30 minutes. She's using HTML Canvas, which is a HTML5 element that is cool. Don't worry about understanding it all, just watch in awe and appreciation, and follow along as best you can.
