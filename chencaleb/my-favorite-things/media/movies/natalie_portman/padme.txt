Padmé Naberrie, known publicly as Padmé Amidala, was a human female politician who became an influential figure in the declining days of the Galactic Republic. Amidala was elected Queen of Naboo at a young age, and led her people through the Trade Federation's invasion of the planet. With the help of the Jedi Order, Amidala was able to lead her people in liberating Naboo from the Federation. When her two terms as queen ended, there was a movement to amend the law so she could continue to serve, but she declined and instead accepted the role of Senator of Naboo.
