Peter Venkman holds PhD's in Psychology and Parapsychology, and was engaged in academic research for many years before forming the Ghost Busters franchise with his partners, Dr. Ray Stantz and Dr. Egon Spengler. He was somewhat unusual for a scientist, and perhaps even more so for a parapsychologist. He had never believed in many of the things Stantz and Spengler took for granted, including reincarnation, Bigfoot, clairvoyance, and astral travel. Venkman customarily referred to these as the "implied sciences," a phrase which entertained his students almost as much as himself.
