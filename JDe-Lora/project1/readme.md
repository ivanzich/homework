Amazing spaceship typing game

My project is about a typing game that contains a letters that you type. The goal is to type what is appearing on the left hand side of the screen, to move the ship to the black hole to win. 

The technology used:

 jQuery to manipulate the DoM and have image of the spaceship to move right. Having a letter generator to select and string of letters to display every new that is pressed in the game. Css for the background and images. html to position all my structure and able to position the way to be called.

 Contribution:

 Fork the project, clone it in your computer. Index in html for the structure of the location. app.js is the js for the manipulating the DoM. style.css is the css file to make the project look nice. Image directory is for the images you want to put in. Have fun. You can add more wirefram input if you like.

 Future features:

 To add another player and the key board cut in half so the people will evenly match on the same computer. Win and lose counter. Adding moving objects in the background (asteriods). Naming the ships. Having a list of ships to choose from.
